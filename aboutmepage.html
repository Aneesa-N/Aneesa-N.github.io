            High school as been an amazing experience, this is do to the schools model of students doing 'work that matters. Original work.'
            Outside of school my favorite pace times are compititive swimming, cooking, and traveling to new and less explored places. 
            As a result of love for exploration my family and I lived abrode the my seventh grade year. living abrode gave me acgreat 
            perspective on our world and how previlige we re to be living in a developed country. I have have a passion for work and i 
            am always ready to learn knew things while figureing out what i want to do with my life!
